## CRUD API for a To-Do List Application

### Intro

In this assignment I was tasked with writing a CRUD API for a to-do list application. I decided to link this creation closely to the role of a backend engineer and also the institution GirlLEAD. I decided to call it **GirlLEAD Backend Engineer API**.

The reason I chose this is because I want to write a to-do list that showcases a day in the life of a backend engineer on the job, using the to-do list to manage their tasks. This reflects what CRUD is all about.

**CRUD** stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**
A CRUD API is a web service that lets clients Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources, like your tasks, over the web.

Now, based on the backend engineer role, this API will allow them to
**Create** â€“ Post or add a new task
**Read** â€“ Get all tasks or one task
**Update** â€“ Put or edit an existing task
**Delete** â€“ Remove or delete a task

### Step 1

I decided to use **VS Code** because I love how versatile and convenient it is. I then made sure I downloaded **Node.js** on my system.

**Tools used**
Node.js
VS Code

### Step 2

I created a folder on my PC and named it
`GirlLEAD_backend_engineer_daily_api`

I opened the folder in VS Code and opened a new terminal. This is what I will use to run commands. Commands are simply ways to give instructions to your computer.

I used Node.js to initialize my project by writing this command in the terminal

```bash
npm init -y

```

This command tells Node.js that I am starting a new project. It creates a special file that manages my projectâ€™s information.
It creates a file called `package.json` which helps me keep track of the project name, version control, and dependencies.

### Step 3

Now I will install the required packages. These packages will add tools that the app needs in order to work properly.

**express** lets me build the API
**mongoose** lets me talk to MongoDB, the database
**dotenv** lets me keep my database link secret
**nodemon** automatically restarts the server when I make changes

Now that I have identified which tools I want to use and how they will each help, I will install them one by one using the terminal

```bash
npm install express

npm install mongoose

npm install dotenv

npm install --save-dev nodemon


```
# npm install express - 
helps build the actual API routes like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
![t2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81156e31-2d13-4fb7-bbb4-9c93d0d9b4c5)

# npm install mongoose
allows the app to communicate with MongoDB, where the tasks will be saved.
![t3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/547ab52c-87c1-4eee-858e-8262a5f0f5c4)

# npm install dotenv
helps create a .env file to hide secret information, such as the database link.
![t4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51a07547-4684-41a6-997b-74e23cee529b)

# npm install --save-dev nodemon
watches the files and automatically restarts the server every time a change is saved.

### Step 4 Create the First Server File

I created the first server file. What role will this file play? Here is what I will do:

* Make a file called `server.js`
* Use this file to start my backend server with Express
* Connect to my MongoDB database using Mongoose
* Listen for API requests

I will call this file `server.js`.

---

### What My server.js Code Does

I import the tools I need â€” Express to build the API, Mongoose to connect to the database, and Dotenv to load secret settings.

I load environment variables from a `.env` file so I can keep my database connection string secret.

I create an Express app and tell it to understand JSON data sent by users.

I connect to my MongoDB database using Mongoose and handle success or error messages.

I set up a simple route `/` that sends a friendly message so I know the API is working.

I start my server, telling it to listen on a port (5000 by default) and log a message when the server is ready.

Got it! Here's your revised section without that extra detail and without mentioning the full connection string. It's clean, in first person, and suitable for your README:

---

### Step 5

**Created the .env File with My Database Link**

First, I needed a MongoDB connection string. I created a file called `.env` in my project.

I then created my MongoDB database link using MongoDB Atlas.

When setting up MongoDB Atlas, I selected **JavaScript** and then **Node.js** as my application language.

I chose this because:

* My backend is built with Node.js using JavaScript
* Mongoose is a library made for Node.js
* Selecting Node.js provides the correct connection string for my project

Once I had the connection string, I added it to the `.env` file using the key `MONGO_URI`.

This is how I connected my project to the MongoDB database.

---

# Step 6
# Run My Server with Nodemon

To test my server, I opened the terminal in VS Code and ran the following command:

npx nodemon server.js

This command did the following:

Started my Express server

Tried to connect to MongoDB using the connection string from the .env file

---

Got it! Hereâ€™s that part with an explanation of why I chose that address:

---

### Step 7

**Tested My Server in the Browser**

I opened my browser (I used Google Chrome, but any browser works like Firefox or Edge).

In the address bar, I typed:
`http://localhost:5000/`

I chose this address because my server is running locally on my computer (localhost) and listening on port 5000, which is the default port I set for the server.

After opening the page, I saw the message:
**Hello, GirlLEAD Backend Engineer!**

This confirmed that my server was running successfully.

### Task8
# Adding To-Do List Features
We will build a CRUD API that allows us to:

- Create a task (POST)

- Read tasks (GET)

- Update a task (PUT)

- Delete a task (DELETE)

This forms the complete set of operations for managing tasks.

---
Thanks for clarifying! Since you have **four separate files** for each CRUD method, hereâ€™s a clean, first-person step summary reflecting that, with the single update to `server.js` at the end:

---

### ðŸŒ¼ Step 8.1: Adding Full CRUD Routes for To-Do List

# 1. **Created `post.js`**
   I started by building `post.js` to handle creating new tasks with POST requests.
![post-03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f2e03cf-3179-4ae9-af97-f303190b06a2)

# 2. **Created `get.js`**
   Next, I created `get.js` to allow fetching all tasks or a specific task using GET requests.
![get-02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d04649-48b4-41de-b151-34fb9bb93f0e)

# 3. **Created `put.js`**
   Then, I added `put.js` which contains the logic for updating tasks, such as editing a taskâ€™s title or marking it completed, via PUT requests.
![put](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/273c32c1-e78d-48d2-838c-86db1f3374ef)

# 4. **Created `delete.js`**
   After that, I created `delete.js` to handle deleting tasks from the database using DELETE requests.
![delete-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/171a3768-97c5-4efb-a018-c5ef314a57c4)

# 5. **Updated `server.js` to include all routes**
   Finally, I updated `server.js` once to import and activate all four route files â€” `post.js`, `get.js`, `put.js`, and `delete.js`. This made my server fully capable of handling all CRUD operations for the To-Do List API.
![server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d3d13-e824-4015-acb7-54bcdb226216)

---
Got it! Hereâ€™s the updated version with the actual output you received included:

---

### Step 9: Confirm Everything Is Working Perfectly

**Step 1: Make sure my server is running**
I ran this command in my terminal:

```bash
npx nodemon server.js
```

I saw the messages:

```
MongoDB connected  
Server running on port 5000
```

This confirmed my backend was connected and ready.
![b1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc73e2b-2d23-4d20-af00-d3453e382675)

**Step 2: Test each route in Postman**

* **GET â€” Get all tasks**
  I sent a GET request to:

  ```
  http://localhost:5000/tasks
  ```

  No body needed. I clicked Send and got an empty array `[]` in response.
  This means the API successfully connected to the database and returned all tasks, but since I had not added any tasks yet, the list was empty. It confirmed that the Read operation of my CRUD API is working correctly.
